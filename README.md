**# FES-week-2-final-project**

Project Objective: Replicate the website found at [this link](https://treact.owaiskhan.me/components/landingPages/SaaSProductLandingPage) (remember to open to new tab!). It is a landing page for Treact.

**Development Process:**

Website Skeleton: Started by laying out the basic structure of the site, ensuring visual similarities with the original in terms of styles, layout, and spacing, especially in a desktop environment.

Animations:

Incorporated sliding underlines for link hovers.  
Attempted to mimic the fade-in effect observed on the original site. However, this effect likely requires Javascript to monitor scroll depth and trigger animations correspondingly. Given my current skill set, I've yet to fully replicate this.  

Navigation Menu: 

A rudimentary version of the menu bar was integrated. Plans are in place to further refine and bring it closer to the original in subsequent iterations.

Responsiveness:

Ensured the design is adaptable and appealing across various screen sizes. However, it's important to note that extremely narrow screens (<400px width) and certain edge cases were not considered, given the project's early-stage context.

Additional Notes:

This project was undertaken during the second week of a front-end boot camp, so my experience in web design is still budding. Regardless, I hope the website offers a positive browsing experience on your chosen device. As my proficiency in front-end engineering grows, I intend to update and enhance various sections of the site.
